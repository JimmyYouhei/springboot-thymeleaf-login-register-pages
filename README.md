 ## Introduction
 
 This project is my Funix 3 assignment. However I redo the project using Spring Boot (with Spring MVC and Spring Security) and Thymeleaf to make login and register pages

-	Spring Tool Suite 4 (Version: 4.3.2.RELEASE) 
-	Maven (version 3.6.1)
-	Tomcat (version 9.0.22) but not included in this assignment. As a result please download yourself 
-	Bootstrap (version 4.3.1)
- Other components are used according to “pom.xml” in each project

## Project Detail:
